# Implementation Tasks

## Phase 2: Core Timeline Features

### Timeline Data Structure Implementation

1. Create Timeline and Event interfaces
2. Implement data validation
3. Set up state management for timelines
4. Create timeline context and hooks

### Timeline CRUD Operations

1. Create TimelineService for data operations
2. Implement timeline creation form
3. Add timeline editing capabilities
4. Create timeline deletion with confirmation
5. Add draft saving functionality

### Timeline Visualization Component

1. Research and select visualization library
2. Create base Timeline component
3. Implement zoom controls
4. Add horizontal/vertical view toggle
5. Create event rendering system
6. Implement timeline navigation

### Event Management

1. Create EventForm component
2. Implement event CRUD operations
3. Add media attachment support
4. Create event categorization system
5. Implement event validation

### Drag-and-Drop Implementation

1. Set up drag-and-drop library
2. Implement event reordering
3. Add position validation
4. Create drag preview
5. Add touch support for mobile

## Next Steps

Start with implementing the Timeline and Event interfaces, then move on to creating the basic TimelineService for data operations. This will provide the foundation for the visualization and event management features.

## Technical Considerations

- Use TypeScript interfaces for type safety
- Implement proper error handling
- Add unit tests for critical components
- Ensure responsive design throughout
- Follow accessibility guidelines
