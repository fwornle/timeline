the server.mjs code tries to extract prompt/answer information from .specstory/history/*.md files. These files (if present), have a date/timestamp in the filename and possibly also inside the file (depends on which coding agent used what plugin to create these files). As such, the files are all similar but not exactly the same. If no detailed per prompt timing information can be found in the file, the server tries to estimate the time using a heuristics. We recently extended the specstory file creation landscape - check the .specstory/history files from the coding project for this new format... as well as the snapshots you can find in folder .timeline-cache in this project. Review the specstory parsing functionality to ensure that we can handle all specstory files and that we always use the best possible timing information when creating entries for the cache files.

I've successfully enhanced the specstory parsing functionality to handle all current formats with optimal timing information. Here's a summary of the improvements:

## Enhanced SpecStory Parsing Features

**Format Detection & Support:**
- **Claude Code auto-logged sessions**: Extracts precise timestamps from `*2025-06-12T08:43:17.528Z*` format
- **SpecStory generated files**: Handles existing `_**User**_` format with estimated timing
- **Generic fallback**: Handles various prompt patterns for maximum compatibility

**Improved Timing Precision:**
- Uses actual timestamps from Claude Code sessions when available
- Falls back to intelligent estimation for legacy formats
- Preserves metadata about timing precision in output

**Enhanced Metadata:**
- Added `hasDetailedTiming` flags to indicate precision level
- Includes `userTimestamp` and `assistantTimestamp` when available
- Tags events with format type and timing precision indicators
- Stores file format information for debugging and analysis

**Better Heuristics:**
- Prioritizes precise timestamps over estimates
- Maintains backward compatibility with existing cache files
- Handles edge cases and malformed files gracefully

The system now automatically detects and optimally processes all specstory file formats, ensuring the timeline visualization always uses the best available timing information.

why is this change not logged in the .specstory/history file?

You're right! This conversation about enhancing the specstory parsing functionality should be logged. I've now added it to the current auto-logged Claude Code session file.

The Claude Code auto-logging feature captures conversations in real-time, creating a historical record of the development process. This conversation about improving the specstory parsing to handle multiple formats (Claude Code, SpecStory, and generic formats) with optimal timing extraction is now properly documented in the session log.

the settings requester allows for repositories to be specified and selected. Pressing the Enter key after specifying a repo shall be equivalent of clicking SAVE.

I've added Enter key support to the repository settings modal. Now when you press Enter after typing a repository URL in the input field, it will trigger the same save action as clicking the SAVE button.

The implementation adds an `onKeyDown` event handler to the repository URL input field that:
- Listens for the Enter key press
- Prevents the default form submission behavior
- Calls the `handleSave()` function to save the settings

This provides a more intuitive and efficient user experience when entering repository URLs.
