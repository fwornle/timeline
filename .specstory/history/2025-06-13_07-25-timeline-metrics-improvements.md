the metrics plot still doesn't exhibit ALL days (it swallows the odd one - presumably to fit all data onto one screen). We don't want this, as this is noticable now that we display the weekdays. Change the algorithm as follows: Each day has a fixed minimum width. If the full range can displayed with this minimum width (depends on the screenwhich - which can vary... it has to be responsive!), use the full width and work out the width of each day from there (actDayWidth = screenWidth/numDays). If screenWidth/numDays < minDayWidth then we only display a partial range, only showing numDaysShown = screenWidth/minDayWidth days and scrolling the metrics data horizontally when the marker gets to screenWidth/4 from the edge of the screen (on either side). To select the days to be show initially, the relative position of the marker on the timeline is relevant. Typically we always try to show the beginning of the timeline on the left of the screen, unless the marker is already positioned too far along the timeline that we can still see it. Implement this.

I'll implement the horizontal scrolling functionality for the metrics plot to ensure all days are displayed properly. 

**Implementation:**
1. **Added minimum day width logic** - Set MIN_DAY_WIDTH = 16px per day
2. **Implemented horizontal scrolling** - Chart becomes scrollable when days exceed minimum width
3. **Auto-scrolling when marker approaches edges** - Scrolls when marker is within 25% of edge
4. **Intelligent initial positioning** - Shows beginning unless marker is too far along
5. **Moved local React state to Redux** - Replaced useState with Redux store (ui slice)
6. **Used proper logging** - Replaced console.log with Logger.trace for debug messages

**Key Changes:**
- `src/components/metrics/HorizontalMetricsPlot.tsx` - Complete rewrite with scrolling
- `src/store/slices/uiSlice.ts` - Added metrics plot state management
- `src/utils/logging/` - Added trace method support to Logger system

**Tools used:** Read, Edit, MultiEdit, TodoWrite, Logger integration

There are also these messages that should be bumped to trace level: [DATA] [DEBUG] Raw spec event, Using server-provided stats for spec, Final stats for spec, Successfully parsed spec event

**Assistant:**

Changed all spec-related DEBUG messages to TRACE level in SpecStoryService.ts to reduce console noise:

**Updated Messages:**
- "Raw spec event" 
- "Using server-provided stats for spec"
- "Final stats for spec" 
- "Successfully parsed spec event"
- "Starting spec history fetch"
- "Raw spec history response"
- "Generating stats for spec"
- "Parsed spec event"

**Tools used:** MultiEdit

Also bump these messages to trace level: [DATA] [DEBUG] Parsed git commit, Raw git commit, parseGitCommit input data, Using server-provided stats for commit, Final stats for commit

**Assistant:**
*2025-06-13T07:35:00.000Z*

Changed all git commit-related DEBUG messages to TRACE level in GitService.ts:

**Updated Messages:**
- "parseGitCommit input data"
- "Using server-provided stats for commit" 
- "Calculating stats for commit"
- "Final stats for commit"
- "Raw git commit"
- "Parsed git commit"

**Tools used:** MultiEdit

The console is full of these log messages: [THREE] [DEBUG] [cards] TimelineCard useEffect triggered - change the log level of this message from DEBUG to TRACE

**Assistant:**
*2025-06-13T07:37:00.000Z*

**Issue:** logger.trace was not defined in useDebugLogger hook

**Fixed:**
1. Added `trace` method to `useDebugLogger` hook
2. Added `trace` method to `useLogger` hook  
3. Added `TRACE = -1` to `LogLevel` enum
4. Updated LoggerInstance with trace method
5. Updated switch statement to handle TRACE level

Changed `logger.debug('TimelineCard useEffect triggered')` to `logger.trace()` in TimelineCard.tsx

**Tools used:** Edit, Read

## Session Summary

**Technical Achievements:**
- ✅ Implemented horizontal scrolling for metrics plot with minimum day width
- ✅ Added auto-scrolling when timeline marker approaches edges  
- ✅ Migrated metrics plot state from local React state to Redux
- ✅ Reduced console noise by moving debug messages to trace level
- ✅ Fixed logger.trace implementation across the logging system

**Architectural Improvements:**
- ✅ Followed Redux state management pattern (no local useState)
- ✅ Used Logger class consistently (no console.log usage)
- ✅ Implemented responsive design with dynamic day width calculation
- ✅ Added proper TypeScript support for new logging levels

**Files Modified:**
- `src/components/metrics/HorizontalMetricsPlot.tsx` - Major scrolling implementation
- `src/store/slices/uiSlice.ts` - Added metrics plot state
- `src/data/services/SpecStoryService.ts` - Debug → Trace level changes
- `src/data/services/GitService.ts` - Debug → Trace level changes  
- `src/components/three/TimelineCard.tsx` - Debug → Trace level change
- `src/utils/logging/` - Added trace method support

**Key Patterns Applied:**
- Redux state management for complex UI state
- Conditional logging with proper level hierarchy
- Responsive design with minimum constraints
- Auto-scrolling with edge detection thresholds
