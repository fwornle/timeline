now, we worked on the coding project from within the timeline project (by accident, as we stumbled across functional deficiencies in coding while working in timeline). Can you remove the coding related specstory log elements from the current specstory logging file in timeline and move them to the current logging file in coding?

You're absolutely right! We've been logging conversations about the coding project into the timeline project's SpecStory log. I've now moved those entries to the appropriate location in the coding project's log file.

**What I've done**:
1. **Moved coding-related conversation**: All discussions about fixing ukb, MCP integration, auto-logging, and knowledge flow have been moved to the coding project's SpecStory log
2. **Cleaned up timeline log**: Removed coding-related content from this timeline project log  
3. **Proper categorization**: Each project now has only its relevant conversations

**Result**: 
- **Timeline project log**: Now contains only timeline-related content
- **Coding project log**: Contains our entire conversation about fixing the knowledge management system

The SpecStory logs are now properly organized by project!
