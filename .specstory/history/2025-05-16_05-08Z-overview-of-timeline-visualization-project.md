Based on the documentation in your workspace, this project is a **Timeline Visualization** application with the following core aspects:

## Project Overview

This is a sophisticated 3D timeline visualization application that transforms git repository history and specification files into an interactive, immersive 3D experience. The application is built with React, Three.js, TypeScript, and a Node.js backend.

## Key Features

1. **3D Timeline Visualization** - Interactive visualization of development history
2. **Git History Integration** - Transforms git repository data into visual timelines
3. **Timeline Management** - Create, edit, and delete timelines with events, descriptions
4. **Event Management** - Add events with titles, dates, descriptions, and media attachments
5. **Multiple View Options** - Different visualization perspectives for timelines
6. **Interactive Elements** - Zoom capabilities, filtering, and search functionality

## Technical Implementation

The project follows an **MVI (Model-View-Intent)** architecture using **Redux Toolkit** for state management. The frontend is built with React and TypeScript, using Tailwind CSS for styling. The visualization capabilities appear to be built using Three.js for 3D rendering.

The application also has plans to integrate PlotJuggler-like functionality to show code evolution metrics over time, displaying metrics such as lines of code, file count, commit frequency, and team activity in a horizontal plot component synchronized with the 3D timeline.

According to the `README.md`, the application provides "real-time visualization of development workflows with advanced animation and interaction capabilities" and seems targeted at developers who want to visualize the evolution of their codebase over time.
