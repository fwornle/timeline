## üèóÔ∏è Architecture

### MVI (Model-View-Intent) Pattern with Redux Toolkit

The application follows the **MVI architectural pattern** with **Redux Toolkit** for predictable state management and **automatic state persistence**:

![MVI Architecture](docs/images/updated-mvi-architecture.png)

- **Model**: Redux store with organized state slices (timeline, ui, repository, preferences)
- **View**: Pure React components that render based on state
- **Intent**: Action creators and async thunks that handle user interactions and side effects
- **‚≠ê Persistence**: Automatic state persistence ensures seamless app reload experience

### Frontend Stack
- **React 19** + **TypeScript** for type-safe component development
- **Redux Toolkit** for centralized state management with MVI pattern
- **Three.js** + **React Three Fiber** for 3D rendering and interactions
- **Vite** for fast development and optimized builds
- **Bootstrap 5** for responsive UI components

### Backend Stack
- **Node.js** + **Express** for REST API and git processing
- **File System Caching** for persistent data storage
- **Git Integration** for repository cloning and parsing
- **Mock Data Generation** for development and fallback scenarios

### Key Technologies
- **Redux Toolkit**: Modern Redux with excellent TypeScript support and automatic persistence
- **React Three Fiber**: Declarative 3D programming with React patterns
- **MVI Pattern**: Unidirectional data flow with clear separation of concerns
- **CSS Variables**: Dynamic theming and consistent styling
- **Typed Hooks**: Full TypeScript integration for state management

## üìã Requirements

- **Node.js 18.0+** (for backend and build tools)
- **Git** (for repository integration and cloning)
- **Modern Browser** with WebGL support (Chrome, Firefox, Safari, Edge)
- **4GB RAM** minimum (8GB recommended for large repositories)

## üöÄ Quick Start

### 1. Installation

```bash
# Clone the repository
git clone [repository-url]
cd timeline

# Install dependencies
npm install
```

### 2. Development

```bash
# Start both frontend and backend servers
npm run dev

# Alternative: Start individually
npm run server  # Backend only (port 3030)
npm start       # Frontend only (port 3001)
```

### 3. Access Application

Open your browser and navigate to `http://localhost:3001`

The application automatically starts both React frontend and Node.js backend servers.

## Usage Guide

### Application Screenshots

#### Settings and Configuration

![Timeline Settings](docs/images/timeline-settings.png)
*Repository Settings dialog showing Git repository URL configuration, theme selection (System/Light/Dark), timezone settings for holiday markers, animation speed control, and auto-drift toggle for automatic timeline scrolling.*

![Logging Configuration](docs/images/timeline-logging-config.png)
*Professional logging system with real-time configuration. Features hierarchical log levels (ERROR, WARN, INFO, DEBUG, TRACE) and category-based filtering across 18 different subsystems including UI, DATA, CACHE, GIT, SPEC, and THREE.js components.*

#### Interactive Timeline Navigation

![Timeline Focus View](docs/images/timeline-focus.png)
*3D timeline view showing commit cards positioned along a temporal axis with the current marker. Demonstrates the spatial organization of git commits in 3D space with the signature yellow timeline marker indicating current position.*

![Timeline Hover Interaction](docs/images/timeline-hover.png)
*Detailed commit card view when hovering over timeline events. Shows commit information including title, file changes (+0 ~1 -0), line changes (+20 -10), and date (5/22/2025). Other cards fade intelligently using the timeline occlusion system for enhanced visual clarity.*

### Basic Usage

1. Enter a Git repository URL in the top bar
2. Adjust animation speed using the speed control
3. Toggle auto-drift for automatic timeline scrolling
4. Click on timeline events to view details
5. Use mouse/touch controls to navigate the 3D space:
   - Pan: Left mouse drag / One finger drag
   - Zoom: Mouse wheel / Pinch gesture
   - Rotate: Right mouse drag / Two finger drag

**‚≠ê Your camera position and timeline marker position are automatically saved and restored when you reload the app!**

### Advanced Visual Features

#### Timeline Occlusion System

When you hover over timeline cards, the application automatically enhances visual clarity:

- **Card Fading**: Other cards that overlap or are temporally close fade to reduce visual noise
- **Marker Fading**: Holiday markers and timeline indicators within the temporal range also fade
- **Text Transparency**: Card text properly fades along with the card materials
- **Debug Mode**: Enable debug mode to see green visual indicators showing which elements are being faded

This intelligent system uses bounding box detection and temporal proximity (+1 day future) to determine which elements should fade, creating a cleaner focus on the card you're examining.

### Configuration

Key configuration options can be customized in `src/config/`:

```typescript
{
  animation: {
    speed: 1,
    autoDrift: false
  },
  visualization: {
    cardSpacing: 2,
    timeScale: 1
  }
}
```

For detailed configuration options, see [Configuration Guide](docs/api.md#configuration).

### Architecture Overview

The application uses **Redux Toolkit** with **MVI (Model-View-Intent)** architecture for predictable state management:

![Redux Store Structure](docs/images/updated-redux-store.png)

**Key Concepts:**
- **Timeline Slice**: Manages events and marker position (with persistence)
- **UI Slice**: Controls camera state, interface, and occlusion system (with persistence)
- **Repository Slice**: Handles repository connections
- **Preferences Slice**: Automatically persists all user settings
- **Occlusion System**: Advanced visual clarity through intelligent element fading

## Performance Considerations

- Large repositories may take longer to load initially
- Enable hardware acceleration in your browser for best performance
- Adjust animation speed and auto-drift settings based on device capabilities
- Consider using the built-in performance profiling tools for optimization

## State Persistence

The application automatically preserves your session state:

### **What's Persisted**
- **Camera Position**: Exact camera position, target, and zoom level
- **Timeline Marker**: Current position on the timeline
- **User Preferences**: Theme, animation settings, repository URLs
- **View Settings**: Last used camera mode and animation speed

### **How It Works**
- State is automatically saved to localStorage on every change
- On app reload, your exact view is restored
- Uses Redux Toolkit with MVI pattern for predictable state management
- Persistence is handled through the intent layer for consistency

## Troubleshooting

Common issues and solutions:

1. **White screen / No visualization**
   - Check if WebGL is enabled in your browser
   - Verify hardware acceleration is enabled
   - Clear browser cache and reload

2. **Slow performance**
   - Reduce animation speed
   - Disable auto-drift for low-end devices
   - Close other resource-intensive browser tabs

3. **Repository loading fails**
   - Verify repository URL is correct and accessible
   - Check network connection
   - Ensure repository is public or credentials are provided

4. **State not persisting**
   - Check if localStorage is enabled in your browser
   - Verify you're not in incognito/private mode
   - Clear localStorage and reload if state becomes corrupted
